## TINPO
### What is this?
This is my final-term project for "Digital System Design with Verilog HDL".   
### What does TINPO stand for?
TINPO stands for "TINPO Is Not a Processor, Ok?".   
### OK! So what does TINPO do?   
TINPO is a custom Processor designed by me. I implement it with RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), and TINPO is a single-cycle processor.   
### Will you make TINPO work?   
Not really! My major in university is Computer Engineering, and I prefer Embedded Systems. I make this processor just to pass my final exam and observe how CPU works in detail. So I just make TINPO **work** (function, pre-synthesis, etc), and I do not know if I have capability of upgrading it (pipeline, multi-cycle, etc).
